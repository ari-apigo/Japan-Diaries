      <h1>dear japan...</h1>
      <p>I have been studying the Japanese language since 9th grade. It is actually
        my 3rd language after Korean, which I studied on my own (and can now barely speak).
        Originally, I always wanted to study Korean in a proper educational setting,
        but upon entering university, I found myself already too deep into Japanese.</p>
      <p>In 2017, I travelled to Japan for the first time with my high school Japanese
        language teacher and a small group of classmates. That trip changed my life;
        I fell in love with the beautiful country and have become interested in working
        there professionally in the future. Since then, I have been keen on returning
        to Japan, and I did two years later.</p>
      <p>But another two weeks wasn't enough. I dream of one day visiting all 47
        prefectures (similar to states or provinces) of Japan, but if two weeks
        could only cover a small part of Tokyo, how long would such a journey last?</p>
