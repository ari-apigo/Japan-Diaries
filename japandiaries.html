        <h1>dear japan...</h1>
        <p>I have been studying the Japanese language since 9th grade. It is actually
          my 3rd language after Korean, which I studied on my own (and can now barely speak).
          Originally, I always wanted to study Korean in a proper educational setting,
          but upon entering university, I found myself already too deep into Japanese.</p>
        <p>In 2017, I travelled to Japan for the first time with my high school Japanese
          language teacher and a small group of classmates. That trip changed my life;
          I fell in love with the beautiful country and have become interested in working
          there professionally in the future. Since then, I have been keen on returning
          to Japan, and I did two years later.</p>
        <p>But another two weeks wasn't enough. I dream of one day visiting all 47
          prefectures (similar to states or provinces) of Japan, but if two weeks
          could only cover a small part of Tokyo, how long would such a journey last?</p>

          The second trip to Japan: Tokyo

        <p> This trip was completely funded by and planned by me and my boyfriend. I felt so proud
          of ourselves for succeeding in returning to Japan (he was on the previous trip as well).
          We spent two weeks in Tokyo, and, afraid we would run out of activities, kept some day
          trip ideas in mind. However, we never ended up having time for excursions outside of
          Tokyo, a metropolis too large and interesting to explore within two weeks - even months
          maybe! I kept a journal during this trip, which will guide future in-depth posts
          about this trip! I also went on this trip with the intentions of creating a video
          montage for it, whereas I had the idea of creating a video for the 2017 trip after
          having already come back to Seattle.

          The first trip to Japan: Kyoto, Shizuoka, & Tokyo
          <span>Summer 2017</span>
        </h1>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/FY6k_VtywSg" target="_blank"><img src="2017thumbnail.jpg"></a>
        <p> This trip was planned by my teacher and a travel agency. Upon arriving at Narita
          Airport in Tokyo, we took a connecting flight to Itami Airport in Osaka, where we
          stayed for one night before moving to Kyoto the next day. We stayed in Kyoto for
          two days before transferring to Shizuoka by bullet train, where we experienced
          attending a Japanese high school and stayed with local families. Our last stop
          of the trip was four days in Tokyo.</p>
