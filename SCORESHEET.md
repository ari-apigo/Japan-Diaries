          - -0.5: All file names and links in your project must be lowercase without spaces. Inconsistencies in capitalization may causes issues based on the operating system. 
          - The image files you've pushed contains uppercase extentions, so it breaks on Linux/Mac (2017thumbnail.JPG & 2019thumbnail.JPG). To fix this, rename the files to match the path you have on in the src attribute in `japandiaries.html` on line 52 and 69.
     - 0.5 / 0.5 : Otherwise Good HTML Code Quality
          - -0: Missing closing `</p>` tag on line 61. The linter doesn't check for it because it's valid, but it is bad style.

     - 1 / 1 : CSS Linter
